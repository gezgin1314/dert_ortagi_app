### Adım 2: Çalıştırmayı Yeniden Dene

Önbellek temizlendi ve yapılandırma dosyalarınız doğru. Şimdi son bir kez derlemeyi deneyelim:

1.  **Terminal 1**'de Metro sunucusunun çalıştığından emin olun.
2.  **Terminal 2**'de uygulamayı tekrar başlatın:

    ```bash
    npx react-native run-android
    
Eğer bu adımda hala hata alırsak, `android/build.gradle` dosyasındaki React Native eklentisinin yüklenme şeklini de kontrol etmemiz gerekecektir.

Lütfen şimdi bu komutları çalıştırıp çıktıyı bana bildirin.
